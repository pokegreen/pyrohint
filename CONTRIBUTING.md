# How to contribute

It's great you're reading this, I always appreciate people helping :)
If you want to talk, you can find me on Discord at @kyan0045

## Adding pokemon

When you're adding new or missing pokemon to our [data](https://github.com/kyan0045/pokehint/tree/main/data) folder, please make sure to check your syntax so it doesn't create unnecessary issues that need to be fixed on a later commit.
Please be patient, I might not immediately accept your pull request as I am not available 24/7.

## Adding features

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to me](https://github.com/kyan0045/pokehint/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
  * Please describe what you're adding with comments, this improves readability and allows other contributors people to better/quicker understand what you added.

Thanks,
Kyan Bosman
